# Assassin

Play the classic live-action game Assassin, but with a modern twist. Instead of eliminating players by touching them with objects or placing bombs, players are killed by "shooting" them with your camera. Play with your friends, earn points, and compete with players across the world.

## How to Play

1. Sign up and start a game with your friends
2. Kill your assigned target by uploading a photo here
3. When your kill is confirmed, you are assigned their target
4. Confirm other players' kills for more points
5. Continue until you're eliminated or you become the champion!

## How to Kill

Kill your assigned target by taking a picture of their face. Photos must meet specific criteria:

- Whites of the target's eyes must be visible
- Target cannot be looking directly at the camera (shields up!)

Once you successfully shoot your target, upload the photo here for it to be confirmed by one of your friends. Remember to check here for new kills often!

## Development

This is a project I started with two goals in mind:

1. to write an app using TDD from the beginning, and 
2. to focus on mobile-first design. 

As I'm still finding how TDD precisely fits into my workflow, I've gravitated toward writing functional tests first, followed by any unit tests I think are necessary.
